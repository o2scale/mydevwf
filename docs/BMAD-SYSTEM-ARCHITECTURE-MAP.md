## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The BMad system is a sophisticated AI-driven software development workflow orchestration platform that coordinates planning agents, development agents, and quality agents to deliver software projects. The architecture follows a layered approach:

**Core Layers:**
1. **Workflow Orchestration** - 6 YAML workflows defining end-to-end processes
2. **Agent Teams** - 10 specialized agents with distinct roles
3. **Task Execution** - 23 executable tasks that agents invoke
4. **Template System** - 13 YAML/MD templates for document generation
5. **Validation** - 6 checklists ensuring quality gates
6. **Configuration** - core-config.yaml driving all integrations

**Critical Finding:** The system is highly interconnected with clear separation of concerns but also tight coupling between workflows, agents, tasks, and templates.
